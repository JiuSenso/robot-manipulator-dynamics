# robot-manipulators-dynamics
This repository contains Matlab scripts used to compute Euler-Lagrange dynamic models of a large number of robot manipulators.

**_dynamics_functions_** contains all the functions needed to compute the Euler Lagrange dynamics. In particular:
- `moving_frame_algo.m` 
- `kinetic_energy`
- `inertia_matrix.m`
- `centrifugal_coriolis.m`
- `factiorization.m'
- `potential_energy.m`

Make sure to setup the Matlab path correctly in order to use this library, or alternatively copy and paste it at the end of your scripts.
